# Wormy Scripts for Serotonin-deficient Teenagers

**Worm tracking tools in Python for behavioral neuroscience**

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JALH42/Wormy-Scripts-for-Serotonin-defficient-Teenagers)

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts designed to analyze poorly-recorded videos of _Caenorhabditis elegans_ (_C. elegans_) locomotion. The primary goal is to facilitate the study of the neurological bases of behavior, especially foraging, by providing tools to track and analyze worm movement. These scripts are intended for researchers interested in behavioral neuroscience, neurogenetics, and animal tracking.

## Features

- Pure Python and NumPy-based worm matching algorithms
- Suitable for compilation with JIT tools like Pyccel or Numba for enhanced performance
- Handles noisy or low-quality video data
- Easily extensible for additional behavioral metrics

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JALH42/Wormy-Scripts-for-Serotonin-defficient-Teenagers.git
cd Wormy-Scripts-for-Serotonin-defficient-Teenagers
